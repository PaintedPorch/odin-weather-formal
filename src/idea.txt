-Make a formal version of the weather app following the style below. Make
it responsive.
-Instead of the separate functions to get all forms of data make a normalized
getData() async function that gets the forecast for three days. Invoke this 
a variable and use this dictionary to extract subparts of the data as needed.
-As a minimum, describe the data for the days and present icons as needed.
Apart from that a radio button for celsius and fahrenheit is needed.

-As for the functions. The radio button should change the data onChange.
-The prompt should be cleared .7s after enter is pressed.
-The API provides the icons for the weather, use these via the data.

-For the mobile layout, place the name up top with the searchBar below,
place the unit option below the searchBar.

Tip: Using justify-content: start will prevent overflow to the left, and thus
make scroll a feasible option.
